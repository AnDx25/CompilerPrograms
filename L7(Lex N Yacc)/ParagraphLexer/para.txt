Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of str2 in str1, or a null pointer if str2 is not part of str1.

The matching process does not include the terminating null-characters, but it stops there.The 0th element i.e arr[0] points to the base address of string "golf". Similarly, the 1st element i.e arr[1] points to the base address of string "hockey" and so on.

Here is how an array of pointers to string is stored in memory.
